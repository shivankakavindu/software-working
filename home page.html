Software is a program or set of programs containing instructions that provide desired functionality. And Engineering is the process of designing and building something
that serves a particular purpose and finds a cost-effective solution to problems.</center></font></p>
<p><font color="#ffffff"><font size="6"><center>
Software Engineering is mainly used for large projects based on software systems rather than single programs or applications. The main goal of software Engineering is to
develop software application for improving the quality,  budget and time efficiency. Software Engineering ensures that the software that has to built should be consistent
correct, also on budget, on time and within the required requirements. </center></font></p>

There are Four main Attributes of Software Engineering:-</center></font></p>
<p><font color="#ffffff"><font size="6"><center><ul>
        <li>Efficiency</li>
        <li>Reliability</li>
        <li>Robustness</li>
        <li>Maintainability</li>
</ul></center></font></p>
<p><i><font color="#ffffff"><font size="6"><center>
Software Engineering is a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable study and approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of a software system.

<h2><font color="#ffoooo"><font size="7"><center>  Software requirements</center></font></h2>
<p><font color="#ffffff"><font size="6"><center>
Requirements engineering is about the elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of requirements for software. Software requirements can be of three different
types. There are functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and domain requirements. The operation of the software should be performed and the proper output
should be expected for the user to use. Non-functional requirements deal with issues like portability, security, maintainability, reliability, scalability, performance,
reusability, and flexibility. They are classified into the following types: interface constraints, performance constraints (such as response time, security, storage
space, etc.), operating constraints, life cycle constraints (maintainability, portability, etc.), and economic constraints. Knowledge of how the system or software works
is needed when it comes to specifying non-functional requirements. Domain requirements have to do with the characteristic of a certain category or domain of projects.

<h2><font color="#ffoooo"><font size="7"><center> Software design</center></font></h2>
<p><font color="#ffffff"><font size="6"><center>
Software design is about the process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or component. This is also called
software architecture. Software design is divided into three different levels of design. The three levels are interface design, architectural design, and detailed design.
Interface design is the interaction between a system and its environment. This happens at a high level of abstraction along with the inner workings of the system.
Architectural design has to do with the major components of a system and their responsibilities, properties, interfaces, and their relationships and interactions that
occur between them. Detailed design is the internal elements of all the major system components, their properties, relationships, processing, and usually their
algorithms and the data structures.

<h2><font color="#ffoooo"><font size="7"><center> Software construction</center></font></h2>
<p><font color="#ffffff"><font size="6"><center>
Software construction, the main activity of software development, is the combination of programming, unit testing, integration testing, and debugging. Testing during
this phase is generally performed by the programmer while the software is under construction, to verify what was just written and decide when the code is ready to be
sent to the next step.
</center></font></p>
<h2><font color="#ffoooo"><font size="7"><center> Software testing</center></font></h2>
<p><font color="#ffffff"><font size="6"><center>
Software testing is an empirical, technical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test, with
different approaches such as unit testing and integration testing. It is one aspect of software quality. As a separate phase in software development, it is typically
performed by quality assurance staff or a developer other than the one who wrote the code.
</center></font></p>
<h2><font color="#ffoooo"><font size="7"><center>Software analysis</center></font></h2>
<p><font color="#ffffff"><font size="6"><center>
Software analysis is the process of analyzing the behavior of computer programs regarding a property such as performance, robustness, and security It can be performed
without executing the program (static program analysis), during runtime (dynamic program analysis) or in a combination of both.
</center></font></p>
<h2><font color="#ffoooo"><font size="7"><center>Software maintenances</center></font></h2>
<p><font color="#ffffff"><font size="6"><center>
Software maintenance refers to the activities required to provide cost-effective support after shipping the software product. Software maintenance is modifying and
updating software applications after distribution to correct faults and to improve its performance. Software has a lot to do with the real world and when the real world
changes, software maintenance is required. Software maintenance includes: error correction, optimization, deletion of unused and discarded features, and enhancement of
features that already exist. Usually, maintenance takes up about 40% to 80% of the project cost therefore, focusing on maintenance keeps the costs down
